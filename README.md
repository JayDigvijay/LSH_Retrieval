# LSH_Retrieval

The LSH algorithm consists of 3 parts:
1. **Shingling**: Shingling is performed by running Shingling.py. This generates the pickle files necessary for further steps
2. **Minhashing**: Minhashing.py generates the signature matrix using shingles generated by running Shinling.py
3. **Bucketing**: LSH.py creates the buckets using signature matrix

We can also query the documents using Main_Retrieval.py. This returns the similar documents found through LSH

## Running the code
```
sudo nano Parameters.py
```
Used to edit/check parameters k, r, b, etc. and the MinHash function.
```
python3 Shingling.py
python3 Minhashing.py
python3 LSH.py
```
Performs the LSH operations on the entire data set.
Should be run once, or whenever the code/parameters/data are updated.
```
python3 Main_Retrieval 
```
Initiates system to take user query and return matching sequences
